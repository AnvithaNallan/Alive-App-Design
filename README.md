# Alive-App-Design

A basic UI design for an app that tracks your heartbeat and gives your relevant information about your health.

## :memo: The Process
Started off with setting the look and feel of my app by making a **moodboard** and then assembled a **simple pattern library**. 

Finally sketched out my **interface** with just 3 screens to show how I incorporated colors and elements from my moodboard and pattern library into a cohesive and pleasant interface.

## :computer: Software Used
- **Adobe Illustrator** (Moodboards,Pattern Library and Final Sketch)
- **Figma** (Logo Design)
